# BenCloudServer


## Run the BenCloud Server inside Eclipse

go to the BenCloudServer.java and right click and select "Run as ... Java Application"

## Build the BenCloud Server

To build the .jar file for testing run:

**gradle fatJar**

(this needs to be done before building a Docker image)


## Build docker image for local testing

From the top level source directory

**docker image build . -t bc** (where bc is the image name)

You can then run

**docker images** (and see something like below)

| REPOSITORY | TAG | IMAGE ID | CREATED | SIZE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| bc | latest | ba723880f347 | 3 minutes ago | 317MB |

If you want to run the image issue a command like

**docker run -dit --publish 8080:4567 bc**

the **bc** is the name you gave the image
the **8080:4567** translated the SparkJava default port of 4567 to be exposed on 8080

When you run it, you will see a long string like:

cd6c0dc21defafc9894af4e72e80cbc40237c07f94ab40258082d401e0618f0a

which is the container instance id

So in your browser you should be able to go to **http://localhost:8080** and see the server running

If you then issue the command

**docker ps -a**

You will see a list of the containers, as below

| CONTAINER ID | IMAGE | COMMAND | CREATED | STATUS | PORTS | NAMES |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| cd6c0dc21def | bc | "/bin/sh -c 'java -j…" | 50 seconds ago | Up 48 seconds | 0.0.0.0:8080->4567/tcp | cranky_shirley |

If you want to run a command, in your image, you can do so. But if you run a command that doesn't finish, and you control-c out, it will stop your container.

Command examples you can run, that self finish are:

**docker exec cd6 ls**

where the **cd6** if the first 3 of the container id, in the table above.

You can run top and let it run and exit on it's own like:

**docker exec cd6 top -n 5**

where the **-n 5** will auto exit after 5 iterations

To stop the container run

**docker stop cd6**

If you then run

**docker ps -a**

you will see it is stopped

| CONTAINER ID | IMAGE | COMMAND | CREATED | STATUS | PORTS | NAMES |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| cd6c0dc21def | bc | "/bin/sh -c 'java -j…" | 11 minutes ago | Exited (143) 42 seconds ago | 0.0.0.0:8080->4567/tcp | cranky_shirley |
